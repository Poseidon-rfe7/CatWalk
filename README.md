### Related Items Widget

See all the items that are related to the currently viewed product in a carousel of cards containing a picture of the item and some information. Each card also includes an action button that a user can click in order to compare the current item to the particular related item which will prompt a modal to come into focus listing shared or non-shared features and comparing the price.

### Your Outfits Widget:

A similar widget to Related items. This section is in carousel format containing a single card by default which will allow you to click on it at any time to add the currently selected product into a list called Your Outfits, to store choices and build up a wardrobe or wish list. These cards can also be removed by clicking the action buttons on the top right of the card.
